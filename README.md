## Motivation

RandOddEvenHeatMapper is a tool created for final project of MBG6113 lecture given in Izmir Biomedicine and Genom Center by Ezgi Karaca ([CSB-KaracaLab](https://github.com/CSB-KaracaLab)). 

## Features of RandOddEvenHeatMapper
- provides adjustable matrix size and number range, just by editing the corresponding variables in the jupyter notebook.
```
required_size=100   #please state the matrix size you require
number_range=100    #please state the number range you require
```
- produces a random matrix (i.e. 100*100 numpy array composed of random numbers in range of 0 to 100).
```
random_matrix=np.random.randint(number_range+1, size=(required_size, required_size))
```
- creates a heatmap figure saves it.

- checks the all elements in the produced matrix if they are odd or even.
- creates a heatmap figure that shows odd and even numbers in the random matrix.

## Our folders describe:

- **Script** contains the jupyter notebook script that produces a random matrix and heatmap.
- **Outputs:** contains the output files produced by jupyter notebook script.
