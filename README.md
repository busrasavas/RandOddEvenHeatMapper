## Motivation
Dynamic cross correlation analysis (DCCA) is commonly used for interpreting molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, DCCC is useful to analyze communications among different parts of complex systems. Despite the popularity of this analysis, we noticed that GROMACS does not directly give the relevant outputs. Here, we introduce a simple script that converts the covariance matrix produced by GROMACS covar to cross correlation matrix and creates a heat map figure.

**Quick Example(s)**

```
    #Load the output file of GROMACS covar ascii.
    covar = pd.read_csv(r'../application_example/covar-3a-cgc.dat', sep=' ', header=None)
    
    #Convert the covariance matrix to cross-correlation and save it to csv file.
    np.savetxt("../outputs/cross_corr_3a-cgc.csv", corr, delimiter=" ", fmt='%s')
    
    #Draw the graph and save it.
    fig.savefig('../outputs/cross_corr_3a-cgc.jpeg', dpi=500)
```
## Our folders describe:

- **Script** contains the jupyter notebook script that produces a random matrix and heatmap.
- **Outputs:** contains the output files produced by jupyter notebook script.
